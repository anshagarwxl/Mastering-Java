//Write a program to check whether a person can vote, depending on whether his/her age is greater than or equal to 18.
//        Hint =>
//        Get integer input from the user and store it in the age variable.
//        If the person is 18 or older, print "The person can vote." Otherwise, print "The person cannot vote."
//        I/P => age
//        O/P => If the person's age is greater or equal to 18 then the output is
//        The person's age is ___ and can vote.
//        Otherwise
//        The person's age is ___ and cannot vote.
