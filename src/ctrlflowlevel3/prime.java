//Write a Program to check if the given number is a prime number or not
//Hint =>
//A number that can be divided exactly only by itself and 1 are Prime Numbers,
//Prime Numbers checks are done for number greater than 1
//Loop through all the numbers from 2 to the user input number and check if the reminder is zero.
// If the reminder is zero break out from the loop as the number is divisible by some other number and is not a prime number.
//Use isPrime boolean variable to store the result

// for (int i = 2; i <= number / 2; i++) -> here number/2 is very important. as every number divides itself â€”

//If a number is divisible by anything greater than half of itself (other than itself),
// it would have already been divisible by something smaller.
