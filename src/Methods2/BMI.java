//An organization took up the exercise to find the Body Mass Index (BMI) of all the persons in the team of 10 members.
// For this create a program to find the BMI and display the height, weight, BMI and status of each individual
//Hint =>
//Take user input in double for the weight (in kg) of the person and height (in cm) for the person and
// store it in the corresponding 2D array of 10 rows and 3 columns. The First Column storing the weight,
// the second column storing the height in cm and the third column is the BMI
//Create a Method to find the BMI of every person and populate the array.
// Use the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). Note unit is kg/m^2. For this convert cm to meter
//Create a Method to determine the BMI status using the logic shown in the figure below.
// and return the array of all the persons BMI Status.
