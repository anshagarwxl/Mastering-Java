Mastering-Java

This repository contains a collection of topic-wise Java programs that I'm writing as I learn and explore Java concepts. Each file focuses on a specific topic, feature, or logic-based exercise — aimed at helping me strengthen my understanding of Java programming.
The goal is simple: learn by doing — whether it’s basic syntax, object-oriented principles, or simple problem-solving tasks, I’m documenting it all here for practice and future reference.
