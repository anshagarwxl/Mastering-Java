Mastering-Java

This repository contains a collection of topic-wise Java programs that I'm writing as I learn and explore Java concepts. Each file focuses on a specific topic, feature, or logic-based exercise â€” aimed at helping me strengthen my understanding of Java programming.
The goal is simple: learn by doing â€” whether itâ€™s basic syntax, object-oriented principles, or simple problem-solving tasks, Iâ€™m documenting it all here for practice and future reference.

ðŸ§ª Java Playground
A space for experimenting with Java basics, logic building, and hands-on practice.
